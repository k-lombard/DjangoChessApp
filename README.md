# DjangoChessApp
Work in progress Django Chess App that allows a user to play chess with text based move inputs. Supports user registration/login and move input at the moment. 

Updates Soon:
  1) Implement intuitive frontend with React.js and Redux.
  2) Allow a user to create a chess match with a shareable link (utilizing websockets and React router) to play a friend.
  3) Allow a user to move chess pieces with click and drag instead of text-based move input.
